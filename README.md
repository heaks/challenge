# Captify test challenge

This application includes React on the front-end and Express on the back-end

## Getting started

1. run `npm install`
2. `npm start` in first terminal window
3. `npm run express-server` in the second one

## Notes
I tried to keep this application as simple as possible, without extra code and packages.
Hovever, I used recompose and axios, because I feel more confortable working with these libraries.
